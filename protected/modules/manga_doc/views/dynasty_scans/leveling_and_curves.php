<h1>Leveling and Curves</h1>

<div style="" id="wikipage-inner">
<p>The next step that every image will be subjected to, no exceptions.</br>
Don't be sloppy.</br>
Keep in mind that leveling/curves are used to get rid of the majority of specks, not <em>all</em> of them.</br>
It's highly doubtful that one would get rid of <em>all</em> specks after properly leveling, unless you have a really good page or whatever.</br>
Specks left over should be rid of <strong><em>manually</em></strong>.</p>
