<h1>A Word About Editing</h1>

<div>
    <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In the scanlation world, there are several phrases that are tossed about when talking about modifying the images. The three most heard ones (for me) are cleaning, typesetting, and editing. I tend to take editing as being both a cleaning and a typeset job, but I've seen it used sometimes as just being the cleaning half of the scanlation process. In Dynasty's world, it occupies both cleaning and typsetting. Very rarely will we go with someone doing the cleaning and someone else doing the typesetting.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now about the Low Quality (LQ), Medium Quality (MQ), and High Quality (HQ), speed scans, and not speed scans, business, we tend to see ourselves falling in the HQ area. I wouldn't say we're at the top area, moreso around the lower-mid section of the HQ territory (if you were to imagine it being a tower of some sort, that is). Your mileage may vary. Quality categorization will vary depending on the person, but what's more easily differentiable is whether a group is a speed scanning group or not.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Without getting into the nitty, gritty details, we are not a speed scanlation group. Your demands for FASTER will go unheeded, at best it'll be a good push to get the editor working faster but don't get your hopes up. Chances are you already know we're not a speed scanlation group, but there&nbsp;are always new persons coming from OneManga/Mangafox filled to the brim with impatience.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now onto editing itself. This is arguably the second hardest job to do in scanlation (Japanese takes years to learn, editing not anywhere near that much). Patient or impatient, if you can get yourself able to work with clunky photo editing software for a period of time, then you can become an editor. Being a GOOD editor requires practice and experience. It's very unlikely that you will be accepted into this group if you became an editor just yesterday, unless you dumped quite a lot of time into sharpening your new knowledge and skills.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I personally spent about 3 weeks doing on and off practicing before I got the balls to attempt the editor test (old version). I would say I went a bit overboard, but by just toying around with Photoshop with only simple guides and Google to help me, I learned my way around better. If you just read guides and single articles on how to use one tool, you're going to be more rigid in your methods than if you experimented (I put HEAVY emphasis on experimenting when you're becoming an editor, as you'll soon see). I was quite rigid, I admit. I felt that there were no alternatives to things like leveling and redrawing and whatnot when I started out. Smacking my old self sure would be great if it were possible :]&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When you're practicing, you should focus on experimenting and redoing the same page in different ways. While it may be a bit boring to do the same page, if it's a tough page then you'll be more motivated to find easier ways for yourself to handle it. I like to joke a lot about having the editor test be the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">terrible</span>&nbsp;scans of Tokyopop's Chobits rendition because it's what I practiced with. I doubt many of you would do the same, but I edited and re-edited the first chapter at least 3 times.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">"Edit what? It's in English already!"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Yes, and the English did help me a little with text placement and font size decisions. It certainly wasn't perfect though.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Examples:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://img691.imageshack.us/i/chobits1005.jpg/" target="_blank">http://img691.imageshack.us/i/chobits1005.jpg/</a>&nbsp;Mmmm, gutter and TILT&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://img34.imageshack.us/i/chobits1022.jpg/" target="_blank">http://img34.imageshack.us/i/chobits1022.jpg/</a>&nbsp;Face and minor hair redrawing&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://img138.imageshack.us/i/chobits1006007.jpg/" target="_blank">http://img138.imageshack.us/i/chobits1006007.jpg/</a>&nbsp;...I learned some cloning and how one has to be more careful with leveling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Whether Cassidy was desperate or honestly saw some good stuff in my editor test, I have to say that Chobits was a BIG help. If you've ever played a game on a hard difficulty then moved down to a lower one, you get the feeling of "WHOA, THIS IS SO EASY." Yeah, same feeling.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">In any case, you should find some RAW (not pre-leveled) images other than the editor test. You must also be able to take criticism and use that criticism to improve on the edit, since that's what we do during quality checking. 99% of the time, you made grievous, but 100% correctable, errors. Learn how to fix them and to not do it again, and you're well on your way to joining us.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Of course, if you just want to learn how to edit for another group or something, you should've skipped this post and headed for the juicy parts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">TL;DR, editing is hard.&nbsp;</span></p>
