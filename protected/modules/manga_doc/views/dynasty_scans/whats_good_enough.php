<h1>What's Good Enough</h1>


<div>
<p>Hundreds of scanlation groups exist and their standards vary greatly.</br>
How can one figure out if their test (assuming a test was done...) is good enough without having to consult the group themselves (who may be busy or jerks)?</br>
The easiest way is to compare it to the stuff they already released <em>recently</em>.</br>
You can view their font choices, typesetting styles, cleaning efficiency, page settings, and a few other things I can't think of right now, right from their own releases.</br>
Do <em>not</em>&nbsp;compare it to their older releases (six months or more)&nbsp;<em>unless</em>&nbsp;you're confident that the release was done by someone better (who may not have worked on something recently put out or is no longer with the group).</p>

<p>Another thing you could do is to read up on multiple scanlation tutorials, which I hope you already have done or are willing to do, because they can provide varying perspectives on the same thing and provide alternatives for you to employ.</br>
There's no way this wiki tutorial can cover everything that you can possibly encounter so it's best to explore.</p>

<p>You could also take a break before handing it in to whichever group you're applying for.</br>
The break should be sufficient enough that you'll forget a good amount of stuff that you did for the test/page/chapter/whatever and thus provide you with a "fresh" enough mind to quality check your own work.</br>
While yes, you're not applying to be a quality checker, you should still be able to see some flaws that may come up after you take a break.</br>
The problem with this is that since you're reading this tutorial, you're probably not familiar with what's good and what's not.</br>
But that's okay, you should still probably see at least one thing that'll seem "off" or incorrect to you and you can then fix it up.</p>

<p>The reason another person quality checks is because they don't know what you did or what you were thinking, all they can see is what is on that page.</br>
When the same person who edited the chapter or whatever quality checks the page(s), his/her brain already has the mentality of "I did this" and "I meant this" and so on, leaving a lot of room for error.</br>
Strangers/fresh eyes will have none of that, they'll only be presented with questions like "Why is this here?" and "That doesn't look normal" which is why it's highly effective <strong>if they're capable</strong>.&nbsp;</br>
Having unqualified quality checkers is nearly the same as having none at all, to be quite honest.</br>
Too many groups attempt to seem more "higher quality" by having this position when it's largely ineffective.</p>

<p>But enough of that, what I was trying to get at is that if you're only going to have the balls to submit the test once <em>even though you're more than welcome to try again</em>&nbsp;then find someone who can look it over for you.</br>
It'll be a great help.</br>
And there's no harm in comparing what you've done to a much higher quality work that's been released by someone else, starting the bar high will allow you to easily pass a lower bar (cough Chobits cough).</br>
There's also the "fuck that, I'll just hand it in" approach, that can work too.</br>
Whatever floats your boat; the effort you put in will be seen in the resulting work.</p>
