<h1>Convert Your Image to Grayscale</h1>


<p>You will get all different types of scans, depending on their source. Here's how you can be sure you're editing them in the proper format.</p>

<p>Click "Image"(Alt+I) at the top of Photoshop. Next move down to "Mode" and slide over to "Grayscale" and click it.</p>

<p align="center"><?php echo CHtml::image(Yii::app()->controller->module->registerImage_tutorial('Leveling_01.jpg'), "image");?></p>

<p>Easy enough, right? That's all it takes!</p>
