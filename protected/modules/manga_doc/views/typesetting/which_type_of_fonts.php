<h1>Which Type of Fonts</h1>


<p><b>So which type of font should you use?</b></p>

<p>I think one of the most common mistakes you'll see in scanlation from someone new or from a group who doesn't hold as high a standard as we do is terrible font selection. When I mean terrible, it's more along the lines of non comic font in a comic setting. Would you send someone a condolences card with smiley faces and hearts on it? Here's an example of bad font selection compared to a good one.</p>

<table align="center">
    <tr>
        <td><?php echo CHtml::image(Yii::app()->controller->module->registerImage_tutorial('01-001.png'), "image1");?></td>
        <td><?php echo CHtml::image(Yii::app()->controller->module->registerImage_tutorial('01-002.png'), "image2");?></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Notice that they're both the same, but you tell me which one looks better? Exactly! Here's a fonts pack I'll share with you to get you started. Of course over time as an editor your font selection will grow and grow and grow! Never be complacent with using the same 5 fonts over and over again. Visit sites like dafont.com and browse through their selections to find new stuff to keep it fresh for yourself.</p>

<p>You'd be surprised that after editing for six years (at the time I'm writing this guide) one of the things that keeps it fresh for me is to change a new series up with a fresh set of fonts.</p>
