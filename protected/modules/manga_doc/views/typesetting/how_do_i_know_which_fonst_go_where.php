<h1>How Do I Know Which Fonts Go Where</h1>


<p><b>This script is confusing, it doesn't tell me what font to use!</b></p>

<p>Oh but it does young grasshopper. :) Here I'll explain to you how our scripts work and the meanings of some of the terms we use!</p>

<p>First let's start of by showing you the script key. You can find this on the main page of our group site and as an editor or typesetter it's something you should memorize.</p>

<p>
[...] for translator's notes<br>
-...- for sound effects<br>
*...* for signs and the like<br>
@...@ for handwritten text<br>
_..._ for emphasis, italicized titles, etc.<br>
--- for long lines<br>
(...) for font notes<br>
</p>

<p>Now to explain this I'm going to create a little script example that encompasses them all. Please bare with me, I'm an artist not a writer... >.> You'll very rarely see them all so often but this is for training purposes. Normally your big ones will be sound effects and handwritten text.</p>

<p>
<span style="color:#cc99ff;">
    [...] for translator's notes (This note on the last line is from the translator to the editor or team explaining something that shouldn't be typeset)
</span><br>
<span style="color:#00ccff;">
    -...- for sound effects (All sound effects should be noted with a dash on each end.)
</span><br>
<span style="color:#ff00ff;">
    *...* for signs and the like (Any signs on buildings, bottles, bags, shirts, anything&nbsp;that's&nbsp;an inanimate object with&nbsp;writing&nbsp;on it will be noted with asterisks on each end.)
</span><br>
<span style="color:#339966;">
    @...@ for handwritten text (Almost all&nbsp;handwritten&nbsp;text is small and can be inside or outside of a bubble. You'll need to pick a handwritten font like Augie for these.)
</span><br>
<span style="color:#993366;">
    _..._ for emphasis, italicized titles, etc. (You won't see this one too often. It's when a bubble or in the case of this example, a single word, is bolded or a different font than the rest of the bubble.)
</span><br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">
    --- for long lines (Depending on the translator this could be - or -- or --- or even — so keep your eyes open for these.)
</span><br>
<span style="color:#ff99cc;">
    (...) for font notes (In this example it says "cute". It can say basically anything. This is the translator telling you the font needs to be changed from the normal dialog and a description of how the font should be styled.)
</span>
</p>

<p>Miku<span style="color:#ff99cc;">(cute)</span>: Where are we going today?</p>

<p>Aya: I don't know but<span style="color:#ff0000;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#00ccff;">-crash-</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#339966;">@I don't know but look up there...@</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff00ff;">*DO NOT ENTER* <span style="color:#cc99ff;">[This sign was kind of hard to read so I'm translating it as do not enter because it fits the scene.]</span></span></p>



<hr/>
<p>Some other things to look for in the script are the differences between Narration(a.k.a. Floating Text) and normal text. Here's an example with a matching script for comparison purposes.</p>

<p>Mio: Morning, Chiriko!</p>
 
<p>Chiriko: @Hm?@ …Oh. @It’s you guys…@</p>
 
<p>Chiriko: Looks like you really lived it up over summer break.</p>
 
<p>@The cool crowd should just explode.@</p>
 
<p>Mio: Shut up! @We’re not part of the cool crowd anyway…@</p>
 
<p>-swoosh-</p>
 
<p>Chiriko(thought): Huh?</p>
 
<p>*Reception*</p>
 
<p>Mio: What’s up?</p>
 
<p>Chiriko: Nothing.</p>
 
<p>It seemed like I saw blond hair for a second, but I guess not…</p>
 
<p>So I thought, but…</p>

<table align="center">
    <tr>
        <td><?php echo CHtml::image(Yii::app()->controller->module->registerImage_tutorial('02-002.png'), "image1");?></td>
        <td><?php echo CHtml::image(Yii::app()->controller->module->registerImage_tutorial('02-001_edit.png'), "image2");?></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p><b>#1.</b> Here you have an example of the basic normal dialog font. Notice in the script it's done in this format... (Name: What they're saying.)</p>

<p><b>#2.</b> I have two #2's circled. Notice how they can be inside or outside of a bubble but they're both the same font and both listed in the script @Like this.@</p>

<p><b>#3.</b> This shows the SFX swoosh. Which will always be listed -like this- They can be -mutiple words- or a -single- word.</p>

<p><b>#4.</b> Notice in the script how the font note is (thought) and the font has changed from the normal dialog font? A good way to be certain a bubble is a thought bubble is by the little tiny bubbles coming off the bubble. Nearly all mangaka style their thought bubbles the same. So if the translator misses the font note please do use the thought font if for some reason you feel it's a thought bubble.</p>

<p><b>#5.</b> This is where it gets tricky. A lot of people get confused with this. This is narration/floating text/whatever you want to call it. It's always going to be listed in the script without a character name in front of it. That's the way for you to tell the difference. If there is no character name in the script before the line then it should be put in the narration font. It can be inside of bubbles, inside of boxes, outside of bubbles, inside burst bubbles. It can be all over the place. Just remember, when it doubt check to see if there's a character name (<b>Mio:</b> Morning, Chiriko!) in front of the text.</p>

<p><b>#6.</b> This is an example of something that would be denoted as a sign. It's a plate above a door. An inanimate object containing text.</p>
