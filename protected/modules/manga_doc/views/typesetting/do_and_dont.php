<h1>Do's and Don'ts</h1>

<p><b>All that's great but give me the basics!</b></p>

<p>Okay, sorry, sometimes I'm a little long-winded! Here's some things to remember, in no particular order.</p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:1.5em;">Different characters do no get different fonts.</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span style="line-height:1.5em;">Character 1 and character 2 will both be using the same dialog font. The only&nbsp;</span>circumstance<span style="line-height:1.5em;">&nbsp;this shouldn't be followed is if the actual raw copy differentiates font styles from one character to the next. I've edited&nbsp;</span>hundreds<span style="line-height:1.5em;">&nbsp;of chapters of manga and I've only encountered this once. So don't look for it to happen often (if ever!)</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Once you pick a font for handwritten or narration or thought for the manga, you stick with it.</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span style="line-height:1.5em;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:1.2em;">So often we as editors go through long spurts where we don't want to edit. It's a creative thing, I get it. Then one day we wake up and we can blow through a whole edit in a few hours. Make sure that if you stop part way through an edit that when you start back up again you use the same font you used to begin with. Often you'll see a sudden change halfway through a chapter where all the narration or all the handwritten text suddenly becomes something else and stays that way. Try creating yourself a .txt file wen you begin an edit and each time you encounter a new font, write it down in your .txt file so you can keep track of which fonts are used and where to use them.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:1.2em;">Vertical text.</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span style="line-height:1.2em;">Very very rarely will you ever typeset anything vertically. There's always&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:15.600000381469727px;">exceptions</span><span style="line-height:1.2em;">&nbsp;but it's basically a no-no if you can avoid it. This includes punctuation such as ..... and long dashes â€”. You'll see a lot of groups allow things like the examples below. We do <em><strong>not. </strong></em>We expect these to be removed and typeset horizontally.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<p align="center"><?php echo CHtml::image(Yii::app()->controller->module->registerImage_tutorial('04-002.png'), "image");?></p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:15.600000381469727px;">Do not use handwritten font except for handwritten font. (hah)</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="line-height:15.600000381469727px;">Another issue you'll see a lot is groups using handwritten font for an entire chapter. It simply doesn't belong. Handwritten font should be reserved for ONLY handwritten text in the raw.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:15.600000381469727px;">Don't take it upon yourself to&nbsp;emphasis&nbsp;words.&nbsp;</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span style="line-height:15.600000381469727px;">I know the way we read things in our heads isn't always the same as the translators portray them. That's OK! But please don't take it upon yourself to bold certain bubbles because you feel like they would be conveyed better that way. Our translators are very skilled and if the bubble should be bolded they'll denote it in the script.&nbsp;</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height:15.600000381469727px;">Don't oversize your font.</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span style="line-height:15.600000381469727px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:1.2em;">Just because you have a huge bubble and only a small bit of text doesn't mean you need to increase the size of the font to fill the bubble. Often this looks very bad.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size:13px;">Font colors</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Occasionally you'll run into stuff that's marked by the translators as "flashback" font. This is the only scenario where we allow you to lighten the font to a grey color. It's not necessary but it seems common&nbsp;practice&nbsp;by a lot of editors to do so. Personally I prefer just changing the font style (like most mangaka do).&nbsp;
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:1.5em;">Hyphens</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span style="font-size:13px;line-height:1.5em;">Please and I repeat please, if you're unsure of how a word should be broken visit <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/">http://www.merriam-webster.com/</a>&nbsp;and look it up. Also make sure that your hyphen is always at the tail end of the first part of the word, never at the beginning of the second.</span><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:1.2em;">&nbsp;</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Copy and Paste Vs. Typing</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We recommend that you copy and paste from the script directly into your image editing program. Too often the cause of a misspelling is a typo, not a lack of intelligence. You can do it either way but please be very careful if you plan to type it yourself.&nbsp;
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>
